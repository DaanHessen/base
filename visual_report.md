# BASE Website Visual Report

## Fixed Issues

1. **Footer Copyright Text**
   - Fixed: Verified the copyright text shows correctly as "Â© [current year] BASE by Monsees"

2. **White Blur Overlay Removed**
   - Fixed: Removed white blur that was appearing on top of the background
   - Solution: Modified the `body::before` element to ensure better compatibility and prevent unwanted effects
   - Added `pointer-events: none` to prevent interaction issues

3. **Logo Transition Animation Improved**
   - Fixed: Enhanced the logo transition animation for smoother scaling
   - Updated cubic-bezier curves to `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for a more natural motion
   - Adjusted animation durations and timing

4. **Mobile Navigation Redesigned**
   - Fixed: Made the mobile navigation more visually appealing
   - Increased logo size in mobile menu for better appearance
   - Reduced backdrop blur opacity for a cleaner look
   - Placed social media icons (Instagram, LinkedIn, Email) at the bottom of the overlay
   - Removed redundant "Send us an email" button

5. **Menu Categories Wrapping Fixed**
   - Fixed: Categories now properly wrap to new lines on mobile devices
   - Changed from horizontal scrolling to a flex-wrap layout with proper spacing

6. **About Us Page Mobile Layout Improved**
   - Fixed: Enhanced spacing and structure on mobile devices
   - Adjusted padding and margins for a cleaner appearance
   - Maintained the desktop version's appearance

7. **Mobile Header Consistency**
   - Fixed: Made the mobile header consistent with desktop
   - Updated transition from transparent to blurred background when scrolled

## Implementation Details

The changes focused on improving visual consistency and user experience, particularly on mobile devices. Key improvements include:

- **Animation Refinements**: Updated transition durations and easing functions for smoother animations
- **Mobile Layout Optimizations**: Better spacing, structure, and hierarchy for mobile views
