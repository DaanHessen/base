# CSS Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the CSS refactoring changes made to organize the codebase and eliminate redundancies, duplications, and bad practices.

## Main Changes

### Global Structure
- Organized CSS into a modular structure:
  - `index.css`: Only contains global styles and design tokens
  - Component-specific CSS files: Contains styles specific to each component
  - Eliminated duplicate CSS declarations across files

### Created Component-Specific CSS Modules
1. `Header.css` - Contains styles for:
   - Navigation bar and header elements
   - Navigation links and hover effects
   - Fixed navigation and responsive behavior
   - Logo container and scaling

2. `Layout.css` - Contains styles for:
   - Root layout structure
   - Page content containers
   - Fixed backgrounds
   - Mobile layout adjustments
   - iOS-specific fixes
   - Responsive layout for different screen sizes

3. `Footer.css` - Contains styles for:
   - Footer positioning and structure
   - Mobile footer adjustments
   - Footer-specific element styles

4. `Reservation.css` - Contains styles for:
   - Reservation form components
   - Responsive adjustments for reservation section

5. `Menu.css` - Contains styles for:
   - Menu item cards and layouts
   - Menu categories and sections
   - Interactive elements like hover effects and animations
   - Menu typography and spacing
   - Responsive behavior for menu components

6. `Sections.css` - Contains styles for:
   - Home page section styles
   - Section headings and decorations
   - About section styles
   - Standard section padding and spacing
   - Responsive typography for different sections

### CSS Best Practices Implemented
- Removed redundant media queries
- Consolidated duplicate style declarations
- Used more specific selectors to prevent cascade issues
- Properly organized responsive styles
- Reduced usage of !important flags where possible
- Documented CSS sections with clear comments
- Made better use of Tailwind utilities
- Applied consistent naming conventions for CSS classes
- Created reusable styles for common patterns

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced overall CSS bundle size by eliminating duplicates
- Improved maintainability through modular CSS organization
- Fixed iOS-specific issues in a targeted manner
- Removed unnecessary style overrides
- Better organized responsive breakpoints
- Separated component concerns for easier maintenance

## Complete Organization Structure
The CSS is now organized according to component responsibilities:
1. **Global Styles** (`index.css`): Design tokens, base elements, utility classes
2. **Layout Components** (`Layout.css`, `Header.css`, `Footer.css`): Site structure elements
3. **Feature Components** (`Reservation.css`, `Menu.css`): Specific functional components
4. **Section Components** (`Sections.css`): Page-specific section styles

## Next Steps
The codebase would benefit from further refactoring:
1. Consider extracting common UI components with their styles
2. Evaluate migration to CSS modules or CSS-in-JS for better style isolation
3. Further audit Tailwind usage to ensure optimal implementation
4. Create a design system documentation for all reusable components
5. Implement automated linting for CSS/SCSS to maintain consistency
