# Mobile Optimizations and Bug Fixes

## Task List

- **Investigate Footer Issue:**
    - [ ] Identify pages where the footer overlaps content on mobile.
    - [ ] Analyze CSS and JavaScript related to footer positioning and page layout, especially for the reservation page.
    - [ ] Implement a fix to ensure the footer is always at the bottom of the page, without overlapping content, across all devices.
- **Address Performance Issues (Mobile & Desktop):**
    - [ ] Analyze existing CSS for performance bottlenecks (e.g., complex selectors, excessive repaints/reflows, inefficient animations).
    - [ ] Review JavaScript for performance issues (e.g., long-running tasks, memory leaks, inefficient DOM manipulations).
    - [ ] Identify opportunities for code splitting and lazy loading of components/assets.
    - [ ] Optimize images and other static assets.
- **Improve Image Loading:**
    - [ ] Investigate current image loading strategy.
    - [ ] Explore preloading critical images (e.g., via `<link rel="preload">` in `index.html` or similar techniques).
    - [ ] Implement a solution to ensure the main background image is visible as early as possible.
- **Eliminate Scroll Bars:**
    - [ ] Identify the cause of unnecessary scroll bars on mobile and desktop.
    - [ ] Review CSS for `overflow` properties, element widths/heights, and potential layout issues causing overflow.
    - [ ] Ensure no horizontal or vertical scroll bars appear unless absolutely necessary for content scrolling within specific elements (not the main page).
- **General Code Review & Refinement:**
    - [ ] Review `Layout.css` and related layout components.
    - [ ] Ensure all changes are consistent with existing design and functionality.
    - [ ] Verify that no unintended visual changes occur.
- **Testing & Validation:**
    - [ ] Test all fixes and optimizations on various mobile devices and desktop browsers.
    - [ ] Validate that all reported issues are resolved.
    - [ ] Confirm no new issues have been introduced.
    - [ ] Ensure the site remains visually unchanged where no changes were requested.
